#SKIMBOT
#### A multihack for Team Fortress 2

This project was created years ago in 2010 or 11 as my very first C++ project, 
 and it probably shows.

Skimbot usually breaks after every big update, 
 but stayed broken after the Pyro update, and I never came back to it
 due to leaving the TF2 community and being seemingly manually VAC banned.

I have stripped out all code that is not mine, to protect that super 
 sekrit open source code I am sure the authors never wanted to see on github,
 and to make it impossible to compile for stupid payhack selling skiddies 
 to use in whole.

A huge thanks to the website gamedeception.net, for the free codens that 
 I leveraged and
 for leaking my password and credentials in that last website hack.
